    "\n",
    "To to study populations of 2 strategies we will use a Hawk-Dove game as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "The hawk-Dove game is a coordination game formulated by John Maynard Smith and Georg Price. The aim of the game was to understand the resolution of conflicts by fighting in the animal kingdom.  The game consists of two players, which each have the choice between two possible actions; either they take time to display (dove) before fighting or they can escalate immediately and fight (hawk).  When both players escalate (hawk), they have a 50% risk of being injured (-D/2) and 50% of wining (V/2).  When a dove fights another dove she also wins 50% of the time (V/2) but only after a period of mutual displays to show of strength (-T).  Hawks always win against doves, resulting in a benefit for one (V) and not for the other (0).\n",
